-----
 NDK
-----

* Native development kit for Android 
* Allows development in compiled languages 
  - C, C++ by default
* Reason: speed
* Designed to *extend* apps written for Dalvik
* .so accessed through JNI from Java

------------
C/C++ in NDK
------------

* By default, no C++ exceptions, no RTTI, no STL

  - Can be enabled (with multiple STL implementations).

* Dynamic linking sucks

  - Static ctors called twice, static dtors never called

* Very few libs guaranteed to be present

  - Zlib, dl, EGL+GLES1/2, SLES, jnigraphics, OpenMAX
  - Native activity stuff (with a C API as readable as libPNG)

    * Allows "fully native" code, i.e. JNI is needed for anything useful

* Need JNI to access most APIs.

  - Some frameworks exist, better and worse

-------------------------
OpenGL ES 2.0 in practice
-------------------------

* Cleaned up spec - no immediate mode, etc.
* Drivers suck (everywhere), not in line with spec
* NPOT textures silently fail (Tegra)
* onPause wastes GL context, or *maybe* wastes it

-------
GLSL ES
-------
* No const arrays
* Arrays in spec, might or might not work on a device
* Float precision specifiers, affect performance:

  - highp: 16bit spec, 31bit common - vertices
  - mediump: 10bit spec, 15bit common - bounded distances
  - lowp: 8bit spec and used in practice - colors, normals

::

   lowp vec3 pointLighting(in int light, 
                           in lowp vec3 pixelDiffuse,
                           in lowp vec3 pixelNormal,
                           in highp vec3 pixelPosition);

---
ABI
---

* armeabi - ARMv5+, no native floating point 

  - useless for games

* armeabi-v7a - ARMv7, has hardfp
* SIMD not guaranteed to be present

  - Must check for NEON at runtime
  - Need separate binaries for devices with and without NEON 

----
TLDR
----

* Need separate binaries for ABIs and ABI extensions

* Native is a royal PITA compared to Linux/Windows

* Do not want to use NDK directly

----------
Necessitas
----------

* Qt for Android 
* Beta - no stable yet(To be stable in Qt 5.2)
* Contains Qt creator modified for Android 
* Similar to ADT - fast build/debug cycle
* Generates all Java wrapper code
* Development in C++ or QML/Javascript (or both)
* Qt project file takes role of manifest

--
Qt
--
* C++ framework similar to .NET/Java libraries
* Low overhead mid-level OpenGL wrappers
* QML for declarative apps with Javascript
* Supports *some* phone features 

  - Qt was built for Maemo/Meego/Meltemi/Mer/jolla

* Cross-platform (Android, BB10, Jolla, Win/Mac/Linux ...)

  - iOS in works (well, Android, too)

----------------------------
Necessitas is not stable yet
----------------------------

* Some stuff must be hand-edited in manifest 

  - Will get overwritten when generated... URRGH

* Android lifecycle is handled on background

  - Qt event loop stops
  - If timing outside the Qt event loop, no onPause/onStop for you
  - Qt ensures GL context does not get murdered


  - No way to onDestroy yet (Qt has an API for it - not implemented yet)

* If a feature is not supported, need to use JNI 

  - Clashing with generated code

---------------
Necessitas apps
---------------

* Ministro
* At first launch, asks user to download the needed subset of Qt
* Gets correct builds for Android version and ABI on device 
* Libs shared between Necessitas apps
* Other libs - must pack with app, built for correct ABI


------------
Aw2D-Android
------------

* Awesome2D for Android

* Proof-of-concept of 3D lighting for 2D graphics 

* In NDK/C++/Necessitas, written specifically for Android/ARM 
  
* Eventually to be cannibalized into an even more cross-platform Awesome2D in D

---------
Awesome2D
---------

* Dynamic "3D" lighting in 2D graphics 

* Using colors/normals/positions pre-rendered from 3D data 

* Reconstructing 3D data per pixel 

* Using (modified) Blinn-Phong lighting

* Graphics comparable to 3D isometric games (Diablo 3)

* Low vertex, medium-high fragment overhead

 
-------------
Current state
-------------

* Basic 3D lighting demo/benchmark.

* The only interactivity is the ability to move two lights.

* Brute force approach at the moment (no texture packing, etc.)

* Surprisingly good performance (considering brute-force)

  - But more benchmarking work is needed 

    * Esp. map loading


--------------
Implementation
--------------

* Basic sprites 

  - No facings yet (need a YAML parser (yaml-cpp?))

* GLSL ES shaders doing the lighting

* Directional, point light sources 

* Uniform wrapper to avoid excessive reuploading
  
  - More readable uniform management; to be backported

* Simple 2D camera

----
TODO
----

* Full sprite parsing

* Map loading

* Optimizations from desktop Awesome2D 

* More ARM-specific optimizations 

  - 16-bit texcoords, vertex & buffer alignment,

* Test more devices/use device specific GL extensions

Thank you for your attention!
